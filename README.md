# Sales-prediction-
In my sales prediction project, I harnessed data science methodologies and machine learning especially ( linear regression)  algorithms to anticipate sales patterns. Employing tools like sci-kit-learn, I crafted predictive models that delved into historical sales data along with various pertinent factors. These models were fed with data encompassing advertising expenses, audience segmentation, and platform choices, ultimately yielding valuable insights. I also used the numpy, panda of python libraries.

In summary, my project illustrated how data science and machine learning can revolutionize sales forecasting, underlining the potential of technology to elevate decision-making and yield concrete business results.
